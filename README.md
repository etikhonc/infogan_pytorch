# infogan_pytorch

Own implementation of the MNIST experiments from the paper InfoGAN: 

"Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets"
by Xi Chen, Yan Duan, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, Pieter Abbeel.

Language: Python 2.7 + PyTorch

As the starting point I took the official implementation by OpenAI and adapted it for personal usage.
Please check:

for the original code. 

The code is intended for private research usage.
